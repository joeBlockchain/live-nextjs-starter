            <p>Best Practices for Optimal Audio Quality:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Use a high-quality microphone or ensure all participants are
                close to the audio input device.
              </li>
              <li>
                Minimize background noise and echoes in your recording
                environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Speak clearly and at a moderate pace to improve transcription
                accuracy.
              </li>
              <li>
                For multi-speaker meetings, try to avoid speaking over one
                another.
              </li>
              <li>
                If possible, use a wired internet connection to ensure stable
                streaming during live recordings.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Pro Tips:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For recurring meetings, create a meeting template to streamline
                the setup process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the &#39;Test Audio&#39; feature before important meetings
                to ensure your equipment is working correctly.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you&#39;re uploading a long audio file, you can start
                reviewing the beginning of the transcript while the rest of the
                file is still processing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take advantage of the &#39;Continuous Speaker Prediction&#39;
                feature in the meeting settings for improved speaker diarization
                in live recordings.

            <h2>Real-Time Transcription and Speaker Diarization</h2>
            <p>
              Real-time transcription and speaker diarization are at the heart
              of our AI-powered meeting management application, revolutionizing
              how you capture and understand your meetings. Let&#39;s dive into
              these powerful features and how to make the most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Real-Time Transcription: Capturing Every Word</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our application leverages cutting-edge speech recognition
              technology to provide accurate, real-time transcription of your
              meetings. As soon as you start recording, you&#39;ll see the
              transcript appear on your screen, updating in real-time. This
              feature is invaluable for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensuring no important details are missed</li>
              <li>
                Allowing participants to focus on the discussion rather than
                note-taking
              </li>
              <li>
                Providing immediate access to meeting content for review or
                reference
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To start a live transcription:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Navigate to the &#39;New Meeting&#39; section</li>
              <li>Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu</li>
              <li>
                Click the microphone icon to begin recording and transcribing
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Pro tip: For optimal transcription accuracy, ensure all
              participants are speaking clearly and one at a time.

              <strong>Speaker Diarization: Who Said What</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most impressive features of our application is its
              ability to distinguish between different speakers automatically.
              This technology, known as speaker diarization, separates the
              transcript into distinct speakers, making it easy to follow the
              flow of conversation and attribute comments to the correct
              individuals.
            </p>
            <p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                As the meeting progresses, the app automatically detects
                different voices
              </li>
              <li>
                Each unique voice is assigned a speaker number (e.g., Speaker 1,
                Speaker 2)
              </li>
              <li>
                You can easily update these generic labels with actual names for
                clarity
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Managing Speaker Identities</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              To make your transcripts more meaningful, you can assign names to
              each detected speaker:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Click on the speaker label in the transcript</li>
              <li>Enter the speaker&#39;s name in the pop-up dialog</li>
              <li>
                The app will update all instances of that speaker throughout the
                transcript
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              For recurring meetings with the same participants, our AI will
              remember speaker voices and automatically assign the correct names
              in future sessions, saving you time and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Improving Accuracy Over Time</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our AI is constantly learning and improving. To help it perform
              even better:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Encourage speakers to introduce themselves at the beginning of
                the meeting
              </li>
              <li>
                If you notice any misattributed speech, you can easily reassign
                it to the correct speaker by clicking on the speaker label and
                selecting the right name
              </li>
              <li>
                After the meeting, take a moment to review and confirm speaker
                identities
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By leveraging these powerful transcription and diarization
              features, you&#39;ll create a comprehensive, searchable record of
              your meetings. This not only aids in creating accurate minutes but
              also provides valuable data for our AI to generate insights and
              summaries, which we&#39;ll explore in the next section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember, the more you use these features, the more accurate and
              helpful they become. So don&#39;t hesitate to start transcribing
              your meetings today and experience the power of AI-driven meeting
              management!

            <p>Sentiment Analysis: Understanding the Emotional Tone</p>
            <p>
              One of the standout features of our application is real-time
              sentiment analysis. As your meeting progresses, our AI analyzes
              the transcribed text to gauge the emotional tone of the
              conversation. Here&#39;s how you can use this feature:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  During the meeting: Keep an eye on the sentiment indicators
                  next to each speaker&#39;s transcribed text. You&#39;ll see
                  color-coded badges (green for positive, yellow for neutral,
                  red for negative) along with percentage scores.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Post-meeting review: In the transcript view, you can hover
                  over these sentiment indicators to get more detailed
                  breakdowns of the emotional nuances detected.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Interpreting the data: Use this information to identify
                  potential areas of concern, moments of enthusiasm, or shifts
                  in the meeting&#39;s tone. This can be particularly useful for
                  sales calls, team discussions, or customer feedback sessions.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Acting on insights: If you notice consistently negative
                  sentiment around certain topics, it might be worth addressing
                  these areas in follow-up meetings or communications.
